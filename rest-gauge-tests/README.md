# README.md file

## This file acts as a readme file and as a small gauge tutorial






### Setup
1. I created a folder one directory up my java project
2. Then I go on the cmd and type *gauge init https://github.com/getgauge/template-python/releases/download/v0.0.3/python.zip*
    * This creates a template for python specifically
3. And boom that's what you need to get started
